# py-respondd role

This role installs py-respondd after cloning it from git.ffh.zone.

py-respondd is mainly written by [descilla](https://github.com/descilla/py-respondd).

It provides a respondd-server meant to run on our gateways in order to make them visible on the map.

We will use the new information to determine the hop distance between a node and his currently chosen gateway.
