- improvements to roles:
    - fastd:
        - fastd debug level
        - fastd_mesh: reactivate config validation
            - maybe change the order of the config snippets
        - fastd user (systemd can give a user to fastd_mesh)
    - ???
        - how to set variables like "git_addr" for all nodes?
    - batman:
        - build it from source

- networkd:
    - systemd-networkd does not properly react to new fastd_mesh interface
        - if this is fixed, mac & batman should be set by systemd-networkd

- roles:
    - tunnel to exit
    - isc-dhcp
    - dnsmasq

- longtime roles:
    - monitoring
    - mail user
        - der meckert bei fehlenden updates
    - update user
        - f√ºr apt-dater
