- improvements to roles:
    - fastd:
        - fastd debug level
        - mesh_fastd: reactivate config validation
            - maybe change the order of the config snippets
        - fastd user (systemd can give a user to mesh_fastd)
        - is the interface brought up automatically?
    - ???
        - how to set variables like "git_addr" for all nodes?
    - batman:
        - build it from source
    - gateway test script?

- networkd:
    - systemd-networkd does not properly react to new mesh_fastd interface
        - if this is fixed, mac & batman should be set by systemd-networkd


- longtime todos:
    - monitoring
    - mail user
        - der meckert bei fehlenden updates
    - update user
        - f√ºr apt-dater
    - look at all radvd parameters

- firewall:
    - rules against flooding
    - should we allow all icmp types?
    - allow dns queries from bat0
    - test whether we can build gre tunnels using ipv6
