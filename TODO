- improvements to roles:
    - fastd:
        - fastd debug level
        - fastd_mesh: reactivate config validation
            - maybe change the order of the config snippets
        - fastd user (systemd can give a user to fastd_mesh)
        - is the interface brought up automatically?
    - ???
        - how to set variables like "git_addr" for all nodes?
    - batman:
        - build it from source
    - gateway test script?

- networkd:
    - systemd-networkd does not properly react to new fastd_mesh interface
        - if this is fixed, mac & batman should be set by systemd-networkd
