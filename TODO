- find out how to update and delete old deployed files?
  - is this possible?

- improvements to roles:
    - fastd:
        - fastd debug level
        - fastd_mesh: reactivate config validation
        - fastd user (systemd can give a user to fastd_mesh)
	    - it has to open tun/tap?
        - is it okay to have the same mac on different mesh interfaces?
    - ???
        - how to set variables like "git_addr" for all nodes?
    - batman:
        - build it from source

- networkd:
    - TODO: fix issues when changing from debian networking to networkd
        - what issues do we have?

    - systemd-networkd does not properly react to new fastd_mesh interface
        - if this is fixed, mac & batman should be set by systemd-networkd
	- batman device can't be set yet

- roles:
    - forwarding
        - firewall
    - tunnel to exit
    - isc-dhcp
    - dnsmasq

- longtime roles:
    - monitoring
    - mail user
        - der meckert bei fehlenden updates
    - update user
        - f√ºr apt-dater
